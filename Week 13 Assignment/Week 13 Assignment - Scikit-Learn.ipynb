    "* Create a pandas DataFrame with a subset of the comns in the dataset. You should include the column that indicates __edible or poisonous__, the column that includes __odor__, and at least one other column of your choosing.\n",
    "    \n",
    "* Add meaningful names for each column.\n",
    "    \n",
    "* Replacthe codes used in the data with numeric values—for example, in the first “target” column, “e” might become 0 and “p” might become 1. This is because your downstream processing in Project 4 using scikit-learn requires that values be stored as numerics.\n",
    "    \n",
    "* Perform exploratory data analysis: show the distribution of data for each of the columns you selected, and show scatterplots for edible/poisonous vs. odor as well as the other column that you selected.\n",
    "    \n",
    "* Include some text describing your preliminary conclusions about whether either of the other columns could be helpful in predicting if a specific mushroom is edible or poisonous."
